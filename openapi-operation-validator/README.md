# OpenAPI for java Operation validator project home

This is the home page of the openapi4j Operation validator project for Java (or JVM platform in general).

Operation validator module includes the following features:

* Operation validator for requests and/or responses.
* Collection of requests/responses adapters for your environment (with associated helpers).

This module is on top of both OpenAPI parser and Schema Object validator and intensively uses it.

The Operation validators are lazily created and cached for re-use by `RequestValidator` object.

⚠ Manipulating the OpenAPI models is discouraged in conjunction with this module. ⚠

## Installation

Add the following to your `pom.xml` :

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.openapi4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>openapi-operation-validator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

[![Snapshot version](https://img.shields.io/nexus/s/org.openapi4j/openapi-schema-validator?style=for-the-badge&color=blue&label=Snapshot&server=https%3A%2F%2Foss.sonatype.org)](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/openapi4j/openapi-operation-validator/)

## Usage

Standard:

```java
// openAPI & operation objects are from openapi4j parser
RequestValidator val = new RequestValidator(openAPI);

val.validate(request, operation); // throws ValidationException
val.validate(response, operation); // throws ValidationException
```

Raw:

```java
OperationValidator val = new OperationValidator(openAPI, operation);
val.validateQuery(request, validation);
val.validateHeaders(request, validation);
val.validateBody(request, validation);
// ...
```

Requests and responses are wrapped with the specific adapter.

```java
// Pseudo
Request request = [Adapter]Request.of([AdapterRequestObject] rq);
Response response = [Adapter]Response.of([AdapterResponseObject] resp);

// validate...
```

## Supported adapters

Adapters dependencies are not provided, you must add the one you need.

See [openapi-operation-adapters](https://github.com/openapi4j/openapi4j/tree/master/openapi-operation-adapters) to get
the list of currently available adapters and further documentation.

Feel free to contribute to add more adapters and additional features.
It should be very straightforward to implement a builder. Look at the code of current adapters as a starter.

## Supported body content types

* JSON (i.e pseudo (application|text)/(json|*+json))
* Form URL encoded (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)
* Or _whatever_ if you can provide a JsonNode or Map<String, Object> when building the body wrapper.

Optional additions (add the corresponding dependencies):

* Multipart (i.e pseudo multipart/(form-data|mixed)) [See Apache Commons FileUpload >= 1.3](https://github.com/apache/commons-fileupload)
* XML (i.e pseudo (application|text)/(xml|*+xml)) [See JSON-java](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java)

Those additions are only mandatory if you can't provide JsonNode or Map<String, Object> or prefer use the provided additions.

Other content types are considered as a single text node to cover direct file uploads (i.e string/binary or string/base64).

## Limitations

* Security and *functional* related aspects (roles/scopes, token/cookie validity, ...) are not validated by this module unless specified on each adapter `README.md`.
In such case, you MUST refer and fallback to your middleware layer for documentation.

Here's a list of currently non supported keywords:

* allowedReserved (maybe forever).
* allowEmptyValue (will be removed in later version OAS).
* XML :
    * Note, prefix and namespace are not considered too since namespace information is always removed before processing. Not really an issue, the information is useless.
    * Note, attributes are kept and always converted to direct children JSON properties.
